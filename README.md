The data that serves [wilhelmlang.com](https://wilhelmlang.com/). They are written in YAML format, because

1. it is machine-readable so that it can be consumed quickly in data pipelines
2. it is human-readable and, thus, easy to modify
3. it supports multi-lines value which is very handy for data of natural languages

### [German](./german.yaml)

```yaml
vocabulary:
  - term: string
    definition: list
    plural: string
    declension/conjugation: string
```

- The `conjugation` is the inflection paradigm for a German verb and `declension` the inflection for nouns and
  adjectives. Only one of the two is present for a term.
- The type of the word can be inferred using the following rule

  - `term` with a _definite article_ of "der"/"die"/"das" and a field of `plural` that comes with it signifies a
    __noun__
  - Those with `conjugation` field denotes a __verb__; its definition also begins with an _indefinite form_, i.e.
    "to ..."
  - The rests are explicitly stated in the `definition` field. For example,

    ```yaml
      - term: ob
        definition:
          - (conj.) if
          - (conj.) whether
    ```

    means "ob" is a **conjunction** in this case and

    ```yaml
      - term: denn
        definition:
          - (adv.) then, thus
          - (conj.) because
    ```

    tells that "denn" can be __adverb__ or __conjunction__
